(* DEVELOPMENT models the aspect of Brouwer's Creating Subject which realizes
 * constructions over time. A value of type DEVELOPMENT.world is a stage in time at
 * which the knowledge of the creating subject may be queried, or to which new
 * knowledge may be added, which are accessible at a new stage. In this sense,
 * the possible values of type DEVELOPMENT.world form a spread, whose law is
 * governed by the admissibility of new knowledge. *)
